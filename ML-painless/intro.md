# Welcome dear reader

The intended reader of this book is a machine learning engineer/data scientist/another buzz word for a smart mathematician who is trying to figure out how to deal with all the application creation steps to serve his/hers machine learning model to the world.

The ideal goal for me as a writter is to have this book bookmarked by as many people as possible and the texts and codes to be copy pasted as much as possible. 

# Motivation for writting 

My journey as a machine learning implementer began by studying mathematical models on a darkboard and using R or Python just to run scripts that generate either a plot or a spreadsheet. When learning the concepts of statistics (or going through the vast majority of online courses about it) the coded project is like a pipeline:

``` 
# All the necesary packages are importated in order for the pipeline to run 
import_packages()

# Reading data data, 95% of the time from a .csv
read_data() 

# scikit-learn, pytorch, tensorflow
model_creation_package_written_by_a_team_of_PHDs()

# model -> "output/model.pkl"
saving_output() 
```

To write such a pipeline in a robust manner takes years of coding and statistical knowledge, but for a business that intends to use the results of the pipeline the work is far from complete. 

This crucial process of creating an API from the outputed model is a weak point for many statisticians who devote much of their time in cleaning inputs, tunining parameters and explaining the results. I was there myself. The playfull nature of web applications' documentations for a mathematician that is used to cold and precises definitions does not help as well. 

Here is where this book comes in handy - I will go through each of the pitfalls and misconceptions I went through personally when learning web development and will try to explain them from a data scientist perspective. 

By talking and working with various software developers as well I found that not many of them know what are the best metrics to communicate to the business owners. Additionally, the most basic of machine learning understanding is needed in this vast world of data even for the people who spend most of theirs days fixing the frontend of an app. 

Thus, I will try to explain some machine learning concepts as well. 

# Acknowledgment 

I do not believe in the "self-made" concept. Each person we meet life adds some value to us, be it a pleasant or unpleasant experience. Thus, I want to thank every person I had the privilage socializing and working with.
