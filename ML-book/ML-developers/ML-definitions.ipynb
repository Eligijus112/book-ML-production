    "In order to deeply understand machine learning, it takes years of studying different subjects in mathematics. To write an efficient framework in any programming language that implements machine learning takes even more time, because not only that you need to know the math but programming as well. We are very lucky that high speed packages exists in R and Python as open source software. In my opinion, the thing that kickstarted the machine learning wave in busineses is that packages like tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-lean are open source. The implementation part which would take the longest time in any project are readily available for free for the whole world to use.   \n",

    "Alot of developers when they see the interview questions for machine learning roles and the material in certain textbooks can feel overwhelmed very quickly. But rarely do we need to write model training from scratch. In most cases, knowledge of the basic definitions of machine learning, some intuition behind certain concepts and the ability to use open source software are all that are needed to create highly accurate machine learning models.
