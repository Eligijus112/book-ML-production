# Overview of the book 

The book is split into two parts:

**Machine Learning for a software developer**

**Software development for a machine learner** 

It is essential to know some concepts of machine learning before trying to implement models in production. That is why we will start from the broad theme of machine learning. 

If you feel very comfortable in one of the themes, skip ahead to the next one. If you are a master of both, please email me at elasorama@gmail.com and share your critism of the book. It is much appreciated!
